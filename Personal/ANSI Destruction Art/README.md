# ANSI Destruction Art

This is a little idea I had when I watched [this music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNYfqklRehM). 

I wanted to build some sort of framework capable of generating the kind of 
output seen in the music video. Not sure how long I'll spend on this, but I'll leave it open source here :)

Current state isn't... great. [But it looks kinda nifty](https://streamable.com/kyyk1), even if the driver code in `art.py` is awful.
